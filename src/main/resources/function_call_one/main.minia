function ident inner ident ends
	is a command line interface application function
	and receives nothing at all
	and returns nothing at all
	so it causes side effects
	and executes statements sequentially
	and does
	print id something id ends
	and then new line
	where id something id ends is bound to 0
end function ident inner ident ends

function ident main ident ends
	is a command line interface application function
	and receives nothing at all
	and returns nothing at all
	so it causes side effects
	and executes a single statement
	and does
	comment
		The `execute` keyword is necessary here, for a function
		call is not a statement but an expression, and a
		function causing side effects should include at least
		one statement (NOT IF THE EXPRESSION CAUSES SIDE EFFECTS?). In order to solve the contradiction, an
		`execute` keyword exists in order to wrap athere........

	execute
	call function ident inner ident ends
	passing no arguments at all
end function ident main ident ends
