function ident inner ident ends
	is a pure function
	and receives nothing at all
	and returns a natural
	comment
		The function features only expressions, no statements,
		hence this clause.
	comment ends
	and does
	return id something id ends
	where id something id ends is bound to 0
end function ident inner ident ends

function ident main ident ends
	is a command line interface application function
	and receives nothing at all
	and returns nothing at all
	so it causes side effects
	and executes statements sequentially
	and does
	print id something id ends
	and then new line
	where id something id ends is bound to
		call function ident inner ident ends
	passing no arguments at all
end function ident main ident ends
